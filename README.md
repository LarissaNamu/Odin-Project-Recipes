# Odin Project: Recipes
## Welcome!
### This project was made, following The Odin Project's curriculum. I decided to continue this project for these reasons:
1. To further hone my web development skills
2. Create a personal project from which I can expand upon with various skills I pick up along the way
3. Have a nice meal prep hub where I, as a college student, can easily find meals that I'm interested in making economically. 
### With this project I hope to learn more about programming in a fun, practical, and effective way by solving a modern problem (what I should eat for lunch) and learning valuable web development skills while I do so. 
### I also hope this project is a project done not just to show that I finished The Odin Project curriculum but also a project I will continuously build upon.
